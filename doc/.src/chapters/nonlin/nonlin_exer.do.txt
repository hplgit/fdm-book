===== Problem: Determine if equations are nonlinear or not =====
label{nonlin:exer:lin:vs:nonlin}
file=nonlinear_vs_linear

Classify each term in the following equations as linear or nonlinear.
Assume that $u$, $\u$, and $p$ are unknown functions and that
all other symbols are known quantities.

 o $mu^{\prime\prime} + \beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime} + cu = F(t)$
 o $u_t = \dfc u_{xx}$
 o $u_{tt} = c^2\nabla^2 u$
 o $u_t = \nabla\cdot(\dfc(u)\nabla u) + f(x,y)$
 o $u_t + f(u)_x = 0$
 o $\u_t + \u\cdot\nabla \u = -\nabla p + r\nabla^2\u$, $\nabla\cdot\u = 0$
   ($\u$ is a vector field)
 o $u^{\prime} = f(u,t)$
 o $\nabla^2 u = \lambda e^u$

!bsol
 o $mu^{\prime\prime}$ is linear; $\beta |u^{\prime}|u^{\prime}$ is
   nonlinear; $cu$ is linear; $F(t)$ does not contain the unknown $u$
   and is hence constant in $u$, so the term is linear.
 o $u_t$ is linear; $\dfc u_{xx}$ is linear.
 o $u_{tt}$ is linear; $c^2\nabla^2 u$ is linear.
 o $u_t$ is linear; $\nabla\cdot(\dfc(u)\nabla u)$ is nonlinear;
   $f(x,y)$ is constant in $u$ and hence linear.
 o $u_t$ is linear;  $f(u)_x$ is nonlinear if $f$ is nonlinear in $u$.
 o $\u_t$ is linear; $\u\cdot\nabla \u$ is nonlinear;
   $-\nabla p$ is linear (in $p$);  $r\nabla^2\u$ is linear;
   $\nabla\cdot\u$ is linear.
 o $u^{\prime}$ is linear;  $f(u,t)$ is nonlinear if $f$ is nonlinear in $u$.
 o $\nabla^2 u$ is linear; $\lambda e^u$ is nonlinear.

===== Exercise: Derive and investigate a generalized logistic model  =====
label{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen}
file=logistic_p

The logistic model for population growth is derived by assuming
a nonlinear growth rate,

!bt
\begin{equation}
u^{\prime} = a(u)u,\quad u(0)=I,
label{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:eq}
\end{equation}
!et
and the logistic model arises from the simplest possible choice of
$a(u)$: $r(u)=\varrho(1 - u/M)$, where $M$ is the maximum value of $u$ that
the environment can sustain, and $\varrho$ is the growth under
unlimited access to resources (as in the beginning when $u$ is small).
The idea is that $a(u)\sim\varrho$ when $u$ is small and that
$a(t)\rightarrow 0$ as $u\rightarrow M$.

An $a(u)$ that generalizes the linear choice is the polynomial form

!bt
\begin{equation}
a(u) = \varrho(1-u/M)^p,
label{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:r1}
\end{equation}
!et
where $p>0$ is some real number.

!bsubex
Formulate a Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and a Crank-Nicolson
scheme for (ref{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:eq}).

!bhint
Use a geometric mean approximation in the Crank-Nicolson scheme:
$[a(u)u]^{n+1/2}\approx a(u^n)u^{n+1}$.
!ehint

!bsol
The Forward Euler scheme reads

!bt
\[ [D^+_t u = a(u)u]^n, \]
!et
or written out,

!bt
\[ \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = a(u^n)u^n\tp\]
!et
The scheme is linear in the unknown $u^{n+1}$:

!bt
\[ u^{n+1} = u^n + {\Delta t}a(u^n)u^n\tp\]
!et


The Backward Euler scheme,

!bt
\[ [D^-_t u = a(u)u]^n, \]
!et
becomes

!bt
\[ \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = a(u^n)u^n,\]
!et
which is a nonlinear equation in the unknown $u$, here expressed as
$u^{n+1}$:

!bt
\[ u^{n+1} - \Delta t a(u^{n+1})u^{n+1} = u^n\tp\]
!et

The standard Crank-Nicolson scheme,

!bt
\[ D_t u = \overline{a(u)u}^t]^{n+\half},\]
!et
takes the form

!bt
\[ \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = \half a(u^n)u^n + \half a(u^{n+1})u^{n+1}\tp\]
!et
This is a nonlinear equation in the unknown $u^{n+1}$,

!bt
\[ u^{n+1} - \half {\Delta t} a(u^{n+1})u^{n+1}
= u^n + \half {\Delta t} a(u^n)u^n\tp\]
!et
However, with the suggested geometric mean, the $a(u)u$ term is
linearized:

!bt
\[ \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} = a(u^n)u^{n+1},\]
!et
leading to a linear equation in $u^{n+1}$:

!bt
\[ (1 - \Delta t a(u^n))u^{n+1} = u^n\tp\]
!et
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Formulate Picard and Newton iteration for the Backward Euler scheme in a).

!bsol
A Picard iteration for

!bt
\[ u^{n+1} - \Delta t a(u^{n+1})u^{n+1} = u^n\tp\]
!et
applies old values in for $u^{n+1}$ in $a(u^{n+1})$. If $u^-$ is the
most recently computed approximation to $u^{n+1}$, we can write the Picard
linearization as

!bt
\[ (1 - \Delta t a(u^-))u^{n+1} = u^n\tp\]
!et
Alternatively, with an iteration index $k$,

!bt
\[ (1 - \Delta t a(u^{n+1,k}))u^{n+1,k+1} = u^n\tp\]
!et

Newton's method starts with identifying the nonlinear equation as
$F(u)=0$, and here

!bt
\[ F(u) = u - \Delta t a(u)u - u^n\tp\]
!et
The Jacobian is

!bt
\[ J(u) = \frac{F(u)}{du} = 1 - \Delta t(a'(u)u + a(u))\tp\]
!et
The key equation in Newton's method is then
[hpl: Check notation here with previously used notation!]

!bt
\[ J(u^-)\delta u = - F(u^-),\quad u\leftarrow u - \delta u\tp\]
!et
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Implement the numerical solution methods from a) and b).
Use "`logistic.py`": "${src_nonlin}/logistic.py" to compare the case
$p=1$ and the choice (ref{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:r1}).

!bsol
We specialize the code for $a(u)$ to (ref{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:r1})
since the code was developed from `logistic.py`. It is convenient to
work with a dimensionless form of the problem.
Choosing a time scale $t_c = 1\varrho$ and a scale for $u$,
$u_c=M$, leads to

!bt
\[ u^{\prime} = \varrho (1-u)^p u,\quad u(0)=\alpha,\]
!et
where $\alpha$ is a dimensionless number

!bt
\[ \alpha = \frac{I}{M}\tp\]
!et

The three schemes can be implemented as follows.

@@@CODE exer-nonlin/logistic_p.py fromto: import numpy@def test_asympt

A first verification is to choose $p=1$ and compare the results with
those from `logistic.py`. The number of iterations and the final
numerical answers should be identical.
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Implement unit tests that check the asymptotic limit of the solutions:
$u\rightarrow M$ as $t\rightarrow\infty$.

!bhint
You need to experiment to find what ``infinite time'' is
(increases substantially with $p$) and what the
appropriate tolerance is for testing the asymptotic limit.
!ehint

!bsol
The test function may look like

@@@CODE exer-nonlin/logistic_p.py fromto: def test_asympt@from scitools.std
It is important with a sufficiently small `eps_r` tolerance for the
asymptotic value to be accurate (using `eps_r=1E-3` leads to a value
0.92 at $t=T$ instead of 0.994 when `eps_r=1E-5`).
!esol
!esubex

!bsubex
Perform experiments with Newton and Picard iteration for
the model (ref{nonlin:exer:logistic:gen:r1}).
See how sensitive
the number of iterations is to $\Delta t$ and $p$.

===== Problem: Solve nonlinear equations arising from a vibration ODE =====
label{nonlin:exer:vib:geometric:mean}

Consider a nonlinear vibration problem

!bt
\begin{equation}
mu^{\prime\prime} + bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}| + s(u) = F(t),
\end{equation}
!et
where $m>0$ is a constant, $b\geq 0$ is a constant, $s(u)$ a possibly
nonlinear function of $u$, and $F(t)$ is a prescribed function. Such
models arise from Newton's second law of motion in mechanical
vibration problems where $s(u)$ is a spring or restoring force,
$mu^{\prime\prime}$ is mass times acceleration, and
$bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|$ models water or air drag.

!bsubex

===== Exercise: Find the truncation error of arithmetic mean of products =====
label{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean}
file=product_arith_mean

In Section ref{nonlin:pdelevel:Picard:CN} we introduce alternative
arithmetic means of a product. Say the product is $P(t)Q(t)$ evaluated
at $t=t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}$. The exact value is

!bt
\[ [PQ]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = P^{n+\frac{1}{2}}Q^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \]
!et
There are two obvious candidates for evaluating $[PQ]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}$
as a mean of values of $P$ and $Q$ at $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$. Either
we can take the arithmetic mean of each factor $P$ and $Q$,

!bt
\begin{equation}
[PQ]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2}(P^n + P^{n+1})\frac{1}{2}(Q^n + Q^{n+1}),
label{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:f}
\end{equation}
!et
or we can take the arithmetic mean of the product $PQ$:

!bt
\begin{equation}
[PQ]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2}(P^nQ^n + P^{n+1}Q^{n+1})\tp
label{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:p}
\end{equation}
!et

The arithmetic average
of $P(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})$ is $\Oof{\Delta t^2}$:

!bt
\[ P(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}) = \frac{1}{2}(P^n + P^{n+1}) +\Oof{\Delta t^2}\tp\]
!et
A fundamental question is whether (ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:f})
and (ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:p}) have different
orders of accuracy in $\Delta t = t_{n+1}-t_n$. To investigate
this question, expand quantities at $t_{n+1}$ and $t_n$ in
Taylor series around $t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}$, and subtract the true
value $[PQ]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}$ from the approximations
(ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:f}) and
(ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:p}) to see what the
order of the error terms are.

!bhint
You may explore `sympy` for carrying out the tedious calculations.
A general Taylor series expansion of $P(t+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)$ around $t$
involving just a general function $P(t)$ can be
created as follows:

!bc pyshell
>>> from sympy import *
>>> t, dt = symbols('t dt')
>>> P = symbols('P', cls=Function)
>>> P(t).series(t, 0, 4)
P(0) + t*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x), (_x,), (0,)) +
t**2*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x, _x), (_x,), (0,))/2 +
t**3*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x, _x, _x), (_x,), (0,))/6 + O(t**4)
>>> P_p = P(t).series(t, 0, 4).subs(t, dt/2)
>>> P_p
P(0) + dt*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x), (_x,), (0,))/2 +
dt**2*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x, _x), (_x,), (0,))/8 +
dt**3*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x, _x, _x), (_x,), (0,))/48 + O(dt**4)
!ec
The error of the arithmetic mean, $\frac{1}{2}(P(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)
+ P(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta t))$ for $t=0$ is then

!bc pyshell
>>> P_m = P(t).series(t, 0, 4).subs(t, -dt/2)
>>> mean = Rational(1,2)*(P_m + P_p)
>>> error = simplify(expand(mean) - P(0))
>>> error
dt**2*Subs(Derivative(P(_x), _x, _x), (_x,), (0,))/8 + O(dt**4)
!ec
Use these examples to investigate the error of
(ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:f}) and
(ref{nonlin:exer:products:arith:mean:p}) for $n=0$. (Choosing $n=0$
is necessary for not making the expressions too complicated for `sympy`,
but there is of course no lack of generality by using $n=0$ rather
than an arbitrary $n$ - the main point is the product and addition
of Taylor series.)

We shall investigate integrals on the form

!bt
\begin{equation}
\int_0^L f(\sum_ku_k\basphi_k(x))\basphi_i(x)\dx,
label{nonlin:exer:fu:fem:int:global}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\basphi_i(x)$ are P1 finite element basis functions and $u_k$
are unknown coefficients, more precisely the values of the unknown
function $u$ at nodes $\xno{k}$. We introduce a node numbering that
goes from left to right and also that all cells have
the same length $h$. Given $i$, the integral
only gets contributions from $[\xno{i-1},\xno{i+1}]$. On this
interval $\basphi_k(x)=0$ for $k<i-1$ and $k>i+1$, so only three
basis functions will contribute:

!bt
\[
\sum_k u_k\basphi_k(x) = u_{i-1}\basphi_{i-1}(x) +
u_{i}\basphi_{i}(x) + u_{i+1}\basphi_{i+1}(x)\tp
\]
!et
The integral (ref{nonlin:exer:fu:fem:int:global}) now takes the

!et
Split this integral in two integrals over cell L (left),
$[\xno{i-1},\xno{i}]$, and cell R (right), $[\xno{i},\xno{i+1}]$. Over
cell L, $u$ simplifies to $u_{i-1}\basphi_{i-1} + u_{i}\basphi_{i}$
(since $\basphi_{i+1}=0$ on this cell), and over cell R, $u$
simplifies to $u_{i}\basphi_{i} + u_{i+1}\basphi_{i+1}$.  Make a
`sympy` program that can compute the integral and write it out as a
difference equation. Give the $f(u)$ formula on the command line.
Try out $f(u)=u^2, \sin u, \exp u$.

!bhint
Introduce symbols `u_i`, `u_im1`, and `u_ip1` for $u_i$, $u_{i-1}$,

and $x_{i+1}$. Find formulas for the basis functions on each of the
two cells, make expressions for $u$ on the two cells, integrate over
each cell, expand the answer and simplify. You can ask `sympy` for
LaTeX code and render it either by creating a LaTeX document and

===== Exercise: Use different symbols for different approximations of the solution =====
label{nonlin:exer:dD:nonlinear:usymbols}
file=nonlin_heat_FE_usymbols

The symbol $u$ has several meanings, depending on the context, as
briefly mentioned in Section ref{nonlin:alglevel:dD:fe}.
Go through the derivation of the Picard iteration method in
that section and use different symbols for all the different
approximations of $u$:

 * $\uex(\x,t)$ for the exact solution of the PDE problem
 * $\uex(\x)^n$ for the exact solution after time discretization
 * $u^n(\x)$ for the spatially discrete solution $\sum_jc_j\baspsi_j$
 * $u^{n,k}$ for approximation in Picard/Newton iteration no $k$
   to $u^n(\x)$

===== Exercise: Derive Picard and Newton systems from a variational form =====
label{nonlin:exer:dD:heat:nonlinear:c:a}

We study the multi-dimensional heat conduction PDE

!bt
\[ \varrho c(T) T_t = \nabla\cdot (k(T)\nabla T)\]

in a spatial domain $\Omega$, with a nonlinear Robin boundary condition

!bt
\[ -k(T)\frac{\partial T}{\partial n} = h(T)(T-T_s(t)),\]

at the boundary $\partial\Omega$.
The primary unknown is the temperature $T$, $\varrho$ is the density
of the solid material, $c(T)$ is the heat capacity, $k(T)$ is
the heat conduction, $h(T)$ is a heat transfer coefficient, and
$T_s(T)$ is a possibly time-dependent temperature of the surroundings.

===== Exercise: Differentiate a highly nonlinear term =====
label{nonlin:exer:grad:pow:term}
file=nonlin_differentiate

The operator $\nabla\cdot(\dfc(u)\nabla u)$ with
$\dfc(u) = |\nabla u|^q$ appears in several physical problems,
especially flow of Non-Newtonian fluids. The expression $|\nabla u|$
is defined as the Euclidean norm of a vector:
$|\nabla u|^2 = \nabla u \cdot \nabla u$.
In a Newton method one
has to carry out the differentiation $\partial\dfc(u)/\partial c_j$,
for $u=\sum_kc_k\baspsi_k$. Show that

!bt
\[ {\partial\over\partial u_j} |\nabla u|^q =
q|\nabla  u|^{q-2}\nabla u\cdot
\nabla\baspsi_j\tp \]

\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial }{\partial c_j}|\nabla u |^q &=

Redo Section ref{nonlin:alglevel:dD:fd} when a Crank-Nicolson scheme
is used to discretize the equations in time and the problem is
formulated for three spatial dimensions.

!bhint
Express the Jacobian as $J_{i,j,k,r,s,t} = \partial F_{i,j,k}/\partial u_{r,s,t}$ and observe, as in the 2D case, that $J_{i,j,k,r,s,t}$ is very sparse:
$J_{i,j,k,r,s,t}\neq 0$ only for $r=i\pm i$, $s=j\pm 1$, and $t=k\pm 1$
as well as $r=i$, $s=j$, and $t=k$.

Consider a typical nonlinear Laplace term like

sparsity pattern as the matrix associated with the corresponding linear
term $\dfc\nabla^2 u$.
