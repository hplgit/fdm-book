======= Implementation =======
label{wave:pde1:impl}
idx{wave equation!1D, implementation}

This section presents the complete computational algorithm, its
implementation in Python code, animation of the solution, and
verification of the implementation.

A real implementation of the basic computational algorithm from
Sections ref{wave:string:alg} and ref{wave:string:impl} can be
encapsulated in a function, taking all the input data for the problem
as arguments.  The physical input data consists of $c$, $I(x)$,
$V(x)$, $f(x,t)$, $L$, and $T$.  The numerical input is the mesh
parameters $\Delta t$ and $\Delta x$.

Instead of specifying $\Delta t$ *and* $\Delta x$, we can specify one
of them and the Courant number $C$ instead, since having explicit
control of the Courant number is convenient when investigating the
numerical method. Many find it natural to prescribe the resolution of
the spatial grid and set $N_x$. The solver function can then compute
$\Delta t = CL/(cN_x)$. However, for comparing $u(x,t)$ curves (as
functions of $x$) for various Courant numbers
it is more convenient to keep $\Delta t$ fixed for
all $C$ and let $\Delta x$ vary according to $\Delta x = c\Delta t/C$.
With $\Delta t$ fixed, all frames correspond to the same time $t$,
and this simplifies animations that compare simulations with different
mesh resolutions. Plotting functions of $x$
with different spatial resolution is trivial,
so it is easier to let $\Delta x$ vary in the simulations than $\Delta t$.

===== Callback function for user-specific actions =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:useraction}

idx{callback function}

The solution at all spatial points at a new time level is stored in an
array `u` of length $N_x+1$. We need to decide what do to with
this solution, e.g., visualize the curve, analyze the values, or write
the array to file for later use. The decision about what to do is left to
the user in the form of a user-supplied function

!bc pycod
user_action(u, x, t, n)
!ec
where `u` is the solution at the spatial points `x` at time `t[n]`.
The `user_action` function is called from the solver at each time level `n`.

If the user wants to plot the solution or store the solution at a
time point, she needs to write such a function and take appropriate
actions inside it. We will show examples on many such `user_action`
functions.

Since the solver function makes calls back to the user's code
via such a function, this type of function is called a *callback function*.
When writing general software, like our solver function, which also needs
to carry out special problem-dependent actions (like visualization),
it is a common technique to leave those actions to user-supplied
callback functions.

The callback function can be used to terminate the solution process
if the user returns `True`. For example,

!bt
def my_user_action_function(u, x, t, n):
    return np.abs(u).max() > 10
!et
is a callback function that will terminate the solver function of the
amplitude of the waves exceed 10, which is here considered as a numerical
instability.


===== The solver function =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:solver}

A first attempt at a solver function is listed below.

@@@CODE src-wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py fromto: import numpy@def test_quad

A couple of remarks about the above code is perhaps necessary:

 * Although we give `dt` and compute `dx` via `C` and `c`, the resulting
   `t` and `x` meshes do not necessarily correspond exactly to these values
   because of rounding errors. To explicitly ensure that `dx` and `dt`
   correspond to the cell sizes in `x` and `t`, we recompute the values.
 * According to the convention described in Section ref{wave:pde1:impl:useraction}, 
   a true value returned from `user_action` should terminate the simulation, here implemented
   by a `break` statement inside the for loop in the solver.
 * return with u_1, remark error if break out of user_action and return [hpl: Later! wait till you see it!]
 * solver as a generator/iterator with yield u, x, t, n [hpl: Exercise?]

#Too trivial here:
#Checking that a solution $u^n_i$ stays constant throughout some
#time steps is often of considerable help in tracking down bugs
#in an implementation. A constant solution $\uex = Q$ fulfills
#the PDE problem (ref{wave:pde2})-(ref{wave:pde2:bc:L})
#if $I(x)=0$, $V=0$, $u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0$, and $f=0$

===== Verification: exact quadratic solution =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:verify:quadratic}

idx{verification!polynomial solution}
idx{nose}
idx{pytest}
idx{unit testing}
idx{test function}

We use the test problem derived in Section ref{wave:pde2:fd} for
verification. Below is a unit test based on this test problem
and realized as a proper *test function* compatible with the unit test
frameworks nose or pytest.

@@@CODE src-wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py fromto: def test_quadratic@def test_constant
When this function resides in the file `wave1D_u0.py`, one can run
pytest to check that all test functions with names `test_*()`
in this file work:

!bc sys
Terminal> py.test -s -v wave1D_u0.py
!ec


===== Visualization: animating the solution =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:animate}

Now that we have verified the implementation it is time to do a
real computation where we also display the evolution of the waves
on the screen. Since the `solver` function knows nothing about
what type of visualizations we may want, it calls the callback function
`user_action(u, x, t, n)`. We must therefore write this function and
find the proper statements for plotting the solution.

=== Function for administering the simulation ===

The following `viz` function

 o defines a `user_action` callback function
   for plotting the solution at each time level,
 o calls the `solver` function, and
 o combines all the plots (in files) to video in different formats.

@@@CODE src-wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py fromto: def viz@def guitar

=== Dissection of the code ===

The `viz` function can either use SciTools or Matplotlib for
visualizing the solution. The `user_action` function based on SciTools
is called `plot_u_st`, while the `user_action` function based on
Matplotlib is a bit more complicated as it is realized as a class and
needs statements that differ from those for making static plots.
SciTools can utilize both Matplotlib and Gnuplot (and many other
plotting programs) for doing the graphics, but Gnuplot is a relevant
choice for large $N_x$ or in two-dimensional problems
as Gnuplot is significantly faster than
Matplotlib for screen animations.

idx{closure}

A function inside another function, like `plot_u_st` in the above code
segment, has access to *and remembers* all the local variables in the
surrounding code inside the `viz` function (!). This is known in
computer science as a *closure* and is very convenient to program
with. For example, the `plt` and `time` modules defined outside
`plot_u` are accessible for `plot_u_st` when the function is called
(as `user_action`) in the `solver` function.  Some may think, however,
that a class instead of a closure is a cleaner and
easier-to-understand implementation of the user action function, see
Section ref{wave:pde2:software}.

The `plot_u_st` function just makes a standard SciTools `plot` command
for plotting `u` as a function of `x` at time `t[n]`.  To achieve a
smooth animation, the `plot` command should take keyword arguments
instead of being broken into separate calls to `xlabel`, `ylabel`,
`axis`, `time`, and `show`.  Several `plot` calls will automatically
cause an animation on the screen. In addition, we want to save each
frame in the animation to file. We then need a filename where the
frame number is padded with zeros, here `tmp_0000.png`,
`tmp_0001.png`, and so on.  The proper printf construction is then
`tmp_%04d.png`.
% if BOOK == "book":
Section ref{vib:ode1:anim} contains more basic
information on making animations.
% endif

The solver is called with an argument `plot_u` as `user_function`.
If the user chooses to use SciTools, `plot_u` is the `plot_u_st`
callback function, but for Matplotlib it is an instance of the
class `PlotMatplotlib`. Also this class makes use of variables
defined in the `viz` function: `plt` and `time`.
With Matplotlib, one has to make the first plot the standard way, and
then update the $y$ data in the plot at every time level. The update
requires active use of the returned value from `plt.plot` in the first
plot.  This value would need to be stored in a local variable if we
were to use a closure for the `user_action` function when doing the
animation with Matplotlib. It is much easier to store the
variable as a class attribute `self.lines`. Since the class is essentially a
function, we implement the function as the special method `__call__`
such that the instance `plot_u(u, x, t, n)` can be called as a standard
callback function from `solver`.

=== Making movie files ===

From the
`frame_*.png` files containing the frames in the animation we can
make video files.
% if BOOK == "book":
Section ref{vib:ode1:anim} presents basic information on how to
use the `ffmpeg` (or `avconv`) program for producing video files
in different modern formats: Flash, MP4, Webm, and Ogg.
% else:
We use the `ffmpeg` (or `avconv`) program to combine individual
plot files to movies in modern formats: Flash, MP4, Webm, and Ogg.
A typical `ffmpeg` (or `avconv`) command for creating a movie file
in Ogg format
with 4 frames per second built from a collection of
plot files with names generated by `frame_%04d.png`,
look like

!bc sys
Terminal> ffmpeg -r 25 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libtheora movie.ogg
!ec
The different formats require different video encoders (`-c:v`) to
be installed: Flash applies `flv`, WebM applies `libvpx`, and MP4
applies `libx264`:

!bc sys
Terminal> ffmpeg -r 25 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v flv movie.flv
Terminal> ffmpeg -r 25 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libvpx movie.webm
Terminal> ffmpeg -r 25 -i frame_%04d.png -c:v libx264 movie.mp4
!ec

Players like `vlc`, `mplayer`, `gxine`, and `totem`
can be used to play these movie files.

Note that padding the frame counter with zeros in the `frame_*.png`
files, as specified by the `%04d` format, is essential so that the wildcard
notation `frame_*.png` expands to the correct set of files.
% endif

# #ifdef MENCODER
## No longer in Ubuntu
# #endif

The `viz` function creates an `ffmpeg` or `avconv` command
with the proper arguments for each of the formats Flash, MP4, WebM,
and Ogg. The task is greatly simplified by having a
`codec2ext` dictionary for mapping
video codec names to filename extensions.
% if BOOK == "book":
As mentioned in Section ref{vib:ode1:anim}, only
% else:
Only
% endif
two formats are actually needed to ensure that all browsers can
successfully play the video: MP4 and WebM.

Some animations having a large number of plot files may not
be properly combined into a video using `ffmpeg` or `avconv`.
A method that always works is to play the PNG files as an animation
in a browser using JavaScript code in an HTML file.
The SciTools package has a function `movie` (or a stand-alone command
`scitools movie`) for creating such an HTML player. The `plt.movie`
call in the `viz` function shows how the function is used.
The file `movie.html` can be loaded into a browser and features
a user interface where the speed of the animation can be controlled.
Note that the movie in this case consists of the `movie.html` file
and all the frame files `tmp_*.png`.


=== Skipping frames for animation speed ===

Sometimes the time step is small and $T$ is large, leading to an
inconveniently large number of plot files and a slow animation on the
screen. The solution to such a problem is to decide on a total number
of frames in the animation, `num_frames`, and plot the solution only for
every `skip_frame` frames. For example, setting `skip_frame=5` leads
to plots of every 5 frames. The default value `skip_frame=1` plots
every frame.
The total number of time levels (i.e., maximum
possible number of frames) is the length of `t`, `t.size` (or `len(t)`),
so if we want `num_frames` frames in the animation,
we need to plot every `t.size/num_frames` frames:

!bc pycod
skip_frame = int(t.size/float(num_frames))
if n % skip_frame == 0 or n == t.size-1:
    st.plot(x, u, 'r-', ...)
!ec
The initial condition (`n=0`) included by `n % skip_frame == 0`,
as well as every `skip_frame`-th frame.
As `n % skip_frame == 0` will very seldom be true for the
very final frame, we must also check if `n == t.size-1` to
get the final frame included.

A simple choice of numbers may illustrate the formulas: say we have
801 frames in total (`t.size`) and we allow only 60 frames to be
plotted. Then we need to plot every 801/60 frame, which with integer
division yields 13 as `every`. Using the mod function, `n % every`,
this operation is zero every time `n` can be divided by 13 without a
remainder. That is, the `if` test is true when `n` equals $0, 13, 26,
39, ..., 780, 801$. The associated code is included in the `plot_u`
function in the file "`wave1D_u0v.py`": "${src_wave}/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py".

===== Running a case =====
label{wave:pde1:guitar:data}

The first demo of our 1D wave equation solver concerns vibrations of a
string that is initially deformed to a triangular shape, like when picking
a guitar string:

!bt
\begin{equation}
I(x) = \left\lbrace
\begin{array}{ll}
ax/x_0, & x < x_0,\\
a(L-x)/(L-x_0), & \hbox{otherwise}
\end{array}\right.
label{wave:pde1:guitar:I}
\end{equation}
!et
We choose $L=75$ cm, $x_0=0.8L$, $a=5$ mm, and a time frequency
$\nu = 440$ Hz. The relation between the wave speed $c$ and $\nu$ is
$c=\nu\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, taken as $2L$ because
the longest wave on the string forms half a wavelength. There is no
external force, so $f=0$, and the string is at rest initially so
that $V=0$.

Regarding numerical parameters, we need to specify a $\Delta t$.
Sometimes it is more natural to think of a spatial resolution instead
of a time step. A natural semi-coarse spatial resolution in the present
problem is $N_x=50$. We can then choose the associated $\Delta t$ (as required
by the `viz` and `solver` functions) as the stability limit:
$\Delta t = L/(N_xc)$. This is the $\Delta t$ to be specified,
but notice that if $C<1$, the actual $\Delta x$ computed in `solver` gets
larger than $L/N_x$: $\Delta x = c\Delta t/C = L/(N_xC)$. (The reason
is that we fix $\Delta t$ and adjust $\Delta x$, so if $C$ gets
smaller, the code implements this effect in terms of a larger $\Delta x$.)

A function for setting the physical and numerical parameters and
calling `viz` in this application goes as follows:

@@@CODE src-wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py fromto: def guitar@if __name
The associated program has the name "`wave1D_u0.py`":
"${src_wave}/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py". Run
the program and watch the "movie of the vibrating string":
"${doc_notes}/mov-wave/guitar_C0.8/index.html".

[hpl: Must recompute these movies as $\Delta t$ is different when
$C<1$.]

===== Working with a scaled PDE model =====

Depending on the model, it may be a substantial job to establish
consistent and relevant physical parameter values for a case.
The guitar string example illustrates the point.
However, by *scaling*
the mathematical problem we can often reduce the need to estimate
physical parameters dramatically. The scaling technique
consists of introducing new
independent and dependent variables, with the aim that the absolute
values of these lie in $[0,1]$. We introduce the dimensionless variables
(details are found in
ref[Section ref{sec:scale:wave:bc_u0}][ in cite{Langtangen_scaling}][the section
"Homogeneous Dirichlet conditions in 1D":
"http://hplgit.github.io/scaling-book/doc/pub/book/html/._scaling-book007.html#sec:scale:wave:bc_u0"
in the book "Scaling of differential equations":
"http://tinyurl.com/qfjgxmf/web" cite{Langtangen_scaling}]

!bt
\[ \bar x = \frac{x}{L},\quad \bar t = \frac{c}{L}t,\quad
\bar u = \frac{u}{a}
\tp
\]
!et
Here, $L$ is a typical length scale, e.g., the length of the domain,
and $a$ is a typical size of $u$, e.g., determined from the
initial condition: $a=\max_x|I(x)|$.

We get by the chain rule that

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar t}\left(\frac{\bar u}{a}\right)
\frac{d\bar t}{dt} =
\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}\frac{1}{a}\frac{c}{L}
= \frac{ac}{L}\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}\tp\]
!et
Similarly,

!bt
\[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =
= \frac{a}{L}\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar x}\tp\]
!et
Inserting the dimensionless variables in the PDE gives, in case $f=0$,

!bt
\[ \frac{a^2c^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2\bar u}{\partial\bar t^2}
= \frac{a^2c^2}{L^2}\frac{\partial^2\bar u}{\partial\bar x^2}\tp\]
!et
Dropping the bars, we arrive at the scaled PDE

!bt
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
\quad x\in (0,1),\ t\in (0,cT/L),
\end{equation}
!et
which has no parameter $c^2$ anymore. The initial conditions are scaled
as

!bt
\[ a\bar u(\bar x, 0) = I(L\bar x)\]
!et
and

!bt
\[ \frac{a}{L/c}\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}(\bar x,0) = V(L\bar x),\]
!et
resulting in

!bt
\[ \bar u(\bar x, 0) = \frac{I(L\bar x)}{\max_x |I(x)|},\quad
\frac{\partial\bar u}{\partial\bar t}(\bar x,0) = \frac{L}{ac}V(L\bar x)\tp\]
!et
In the common case $V=0$ we see that there are no physical parameters to be
estimated in the PDE model!

If we have a program implemented for the physical wave equation with
dimensions, we can obtain the dimensionless, scaled version by
setting $c=1$. The initial condition of a guitar string,
given in (ref{wave:pde1:guitar:I}), gets its scaled form by choosing
$a=1$, $L=1$, and $x_0\in [0,1]$. This means that we only need to
decide on the $x_0$ value as a fraction of unity, because
the scaled problem corresponds to setting all
other parameters to unity. In the code we can just set
`a=c=L=1`, `x0=0.8`, and there is no need to calculate with
wavelengths and frequencies to estimate $c$!

The only non-trivial parameter to estimate in the scaled problem
is the final end time of the simulation, or more precisely, how it relates
to periods in periodic solutions in time, since we often want to
express the end time as a certain number of periods.
The period in the dimensionless problem is 2, so the end time can be
set to the desired number of periods times 2.

Why the dimensionless period is 2 can be explained by the following
reasoning.
Suppose that $u$ behaves as $\cos (\omega t)$ in time in the original
problem with dimensions. The corresponding period is then $P=2\pi/\omega$, but
we need to estimate $\omega$. A typical solution of the wave
equation is $u(x,t)=A\cos(kx)\cos(\omega t)$, where $A$ is an amplitude
and $k$ is related to the wave length $\lambda$ in space: $\lambda = 2\pi/k$.
Both $\lambda$ and $A$ will be given by the initial condition $I(x)$.
Inserting this $u(x,t)$ in the PDE yields $-\omega^2 = -c^2k^2$, i.e.,
$\omega = kc$. The period is therefore $P=2\pi/(kc)$.
If the boundary conditions are $u(0,t)=u(0,L)$, we need to have
$kL = n\pi$ for integer $n$. The period becomes $P=2L/nc$. The longest
period is $P=2L/c$. The dimensionless period $\tilde P$ is obtained
by dividing $P$ by the time scale $L/c$, which results in $\tilde P=2$.
Shorter waves in the initial condition will have a dimensionless
shorter period $\tilde P=2/n$ ($n>1$).

======= Vectorization =======
label{wave:pde1:impl:vec}

idx{vectorization}
idx{parallelism}

The computational algorithm for solving the wave equation visits one
mesh point at a time and evaluates a formula for the new value
$u_i^{n+1}$ at that point. Technically, this is implemented by a loop
over array elements in a program. Such loops may run slowly in Python
(and similar interpreted languages such as R and MATLAB).  One
technique for speeding up loops is to perform operations on entire
arrays instead of working with one element at a time. This is referred
to as *vectorization*, *vector computing*, or *array computing*.
Operations on whole arrays are possible if the computations involving
each element is independent of each other and therefore can, at least
in principle, be performed simultaneously.  That is, vectorization not
only speeds up the code on serial computers, but also makes it easy to
exploit parallel computing. Actually, there are Python tools like
"Numba": "http://numba.pydata.org" that can automatically turn
vectorized code into parallel code.


===== Operations on slices of arrays =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:basics}

idx{scalar code}
idx{vectorization}
idx{array computing}
idx{array slices}
idx{slice}

Efficient computing with `numpy` arrays demands that we avoid loops
and compute with entire arrays at once (or at least large portions of them).
Consider this calculation of differences $d_i = u_{i+1}-u_i$:
!bc pycod
n = u.size
for i in range(0, n-1):
    d[i] = u[i+1] - u[i]
!ec
All the differences here are independent of each other.
The computation of `d` can therefore alternatively be done by
subtracting the array $(u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{n-1})$ from
the array where the elements are shifted one index upwards:
$(u_1,u_2,\ldots,u_n)$, see Figure ref{wave:pde1:vec:fig1}.
The former subset of the array can be
expressed by `u[0:n-1]`,
`u[0:-1]`, or just
`u[:-1]`, meaning from index 0 up to,
but not including, the last element (`-1`). The latter subset
is obtained by `u[1:n]` or `u[1:]`,
meaning from index 1 and the rest of the array.
The computation of `d` can now be done without an explicit Python loop:
!bc pycod
d = u[1:] - u[:-1]
!ec
or with explicit limits if desired:
!bc pycod
d = u[1:n] - u[0:n-1]
!ec
Indices with a colon, going from an index to (but not including) another
index are called *slices*. With `numpy` arrays, the computations
are still done by loops, but in efficient, compiled, highly optimized
C or Fortran code. Such loops are sometimes referred to as *vectorized
loops*. Such loops can also easily be distributed
among many processors on parallel computers. We say that the *scalar code*
above, working on an element (a scalar) at a time, has been replaced by
an equivalent *vectorized code*. The process of vectorizing code is called
*vectorization*.

FIGURE: [fig-wave/vectorized_diff, width=400 frac=0.5] Illustration of subtracting two slices of two arrays. label{wave:pde1:vec:fig1}

!bquestion Test your understanding
Newcomers to vectorization are encouraged to choose
a small array `u`, say with five elements,
and simulate with pen and paper
both the loop version and the vectorized version above.
!equestion

Finite difference schemes basically contain differences between array
elements with shifted indices. As an example,
consider the updating formula

!bc pycod
for i in range(1, n-1):
    u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1]
!ec
The vectorization consists of replacing the loop by arithmetics on
slices of arrays of length `n-2`:

!bc pycod
u2 = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
u2 = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative
!ec
Note that the length of `u2` becomes `n-2`. If `u2` is already an array of
length `n` and we want to use the formula to update all the ``inner''
elements of `u2`, as we will when solving a 1D wave equation, we can write
!bc pycod
u2[1:-1]  = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:]
u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]   # alternative
!ec
The first expression's right-hand side is realized by the
following steps, involving temporary arrays with intermediate results,
since each array operation can only involve one or two arrays.
The `numpy` package performs (behind the scenes) the first line above in
four steps:

!bc
temp1 = 2*u[1:-1]
temp2 = u[:-2] - temp1
temp3 = temp2 + u[2:]
u2[1:-1] = temp3
!ec
We need three temporary arrays, but a user does not need to worry about
such temporary arrays.

!bnotice Common mistakes with array slices
Array expressions with slices demand that the slices have the same
shape. It easy to make a mistake in, e.g.,

!bc pycod
u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[2:n]
!ec
and write

!bc pycod
u2[1:n-1] = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[1:n]
!ec
Now `u[1:n]` has wrong length (`n-1`) compared to the other array
slices, causing a `ValueError` and the message
`could not broadcast input array from shape 103 into shape 104`
(if `n` is 105). When such errors occur one must closely examine
all the slices. Usually, it is easier to get upper limits of slices
right when they use `-1` or `-2` or empty limit rather than
expressions involving the length.

Another common mistake is to forget the slice in the array on the
left-hand side,

!bc pycod
u2 = u[0:n-2] - 2*u[1:n-1] + u[1:n]
!ec
This is really crucial: now `u2` becomes a *new* array of length
`n-2`, which is the wrong length as we have no entries for the boundary
values. We meant to insert the right-hand side array *into* the
original `u2` array for the entries that correspond to the
internal points in the mesh (`1:n-1` or `1:-1`).
!enotice

Vectorization may also work nicely with functions. To illustrate, we may
extend the previous example as follows:

!bc pycod
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 1

for i in range(1, n-1):
    u2[i] = u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1] + f(x[i])
!ec
Assuming `u2`, `u`, and `x` all have length `n`, the vectorized
version becomes
!bc pycod
u2[1:-1] = u[:-2] - 2*u[1:-1] + u[2:] + f(x[1:-1])
!ec
Obviously, `f` must be able to take an array as argument for `f(x[1:-1])`
to make sense.

===== Finite difference schemes expressed as slices =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:vec:slices:fdm}

We now have the necessary tools to vectorize the wave equation
algorithm as described mathematically in Section ref{wave:string:alg}
and through code in Section ref{wave:pde1:impl:solver}.  There are
three loops: one for the initial condition, one for the first time
step, and finally the loop that is repeated for all subsequent time
levels. Since only the latter is repeated a potentially large number
of times, we limit our vectorization efforts to this loop:

!bc pycod
for i in range(1, Nx):
    u[i] = 2*u_n[i] - u_nm1[i] + \
           C2*(u_n[i-1] - 2*u_n[i] + u_n[i+1])
!ec
The vectorized version becomes

!bc pycod
u[1:-1] = - u_nm1[1:-1] + 2*u_n[1:-1] + \
          C2*(u_n[:-2] - 2*u_n[1:-1] + u_n[2:])
!ec
or
!bc pycod
u[1:Nx] = 2*u_n[1:Nx]- u_nm1[1:Nx] + \
          C2*(u_n[0:Nx-1] - 2*u_n[1:Nx] + u_n[2:Nx+1])
!ec

#We may vectorize the other loops regarding the initial condition and
#the first time step, but the effect will hardly be
#noticeable in long time simulations.

The program
"`wave1D_u0v.py`":
"${src_wave}/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py"
contains a new version of the function `solver` where both the scalar
and the vectorized loops are included (the argument `version` is
set to `scalar` or `vectorized`, respectively).


===== Verification =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:vec:verify:quadratic}

idx{lambda function (Python)}

We may reuse the quadratic solution $\uex(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+{\half}t)$ for
verifying also the vectorized code. A test function can now verify
both the scalar and the vectorized version. Moreover, we may
use a `user_action` function that compares the computed and exact
solution at each time level and performs a test:

!bnotice Lambda functions
The code segment above demonstrates how to achieve very
compact code, without degraded readability,
by use of lambda functions for the various
input parameters that require a Python function. In essence,

!bc pycod
f = lambda x, t: L*(x-t)**2
!ec
is equivalent to

!bc pycod
def f(x, t):
    return L(x-t)**2
!ec
Note that lambda functions can just contain a single expression and no
statements.

One advantage with lambda functions is that they can be used directly
in calls:

!bc pycod
solver(I=lambda x: sin(pi*x/L), V=0, f=0, ...)
!ec
!enotice

===== Efficiency measurements =====

The `wave1D_u0v.py` contains our new `solver` function with both
scalar and vectorized code. For comparing the efficiency
of scalar versus vectorized code, we need a `viz` function
as discussed in Section ref{wave:pde1:impl:animate}.
All of this `viz` function can be reused, except the call
to `solver_function`. This call lacks the parameter
`version`, which we want to set to `vectorized` and `scalar`
for our efficiency measurements.

One solution is to copy the `viz` code from `wave1D_u0` into
`wave1D_u0v.py` and add a `version` argument to the `solver_function` call.
Taking into account how much animation code we
then duplicate, this is not a good idea.
Alternatively,
introducing the `version` argument in `wave1D_u0.viz`, so that this function
can be imported into `wave1D_u0v.py`, is not
a good solution either, since `version` has no meaning in that file.
We need better ideas!

=== Solution 1 ===

Calling `viz` in `wave1D_u0` with `solver_function` as our new
solver in `wave1D_u0v` works fine, since this solver has
`version='vectorized'` as default value. The problem arises when we
want to test `version='vectorized'`. The simplest solution is then
to use `wave1D_u0.solver` instead. We make a new `viz` function
in `wave1D_u0v.py` that has a `version` argument and that just
calls `wave1D_u0.viz`:

@@@CODE src-wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0v.py fromto: def viz@# Method 2

=== Solution 2 ===

There is a more advanced and fancier solution featuring a very useful trick:
we can make a new function that will always call `wave1D_u0v.solver`
with `version='scalar'`. The `functools.partial` function from
standard Python takes a function `func` as argument and
a series of positional and keyword arguments and returns a
new function that will call `func` with the supplied arguments,
while the user can control all the other arguments in `func`.
Consider a trivial example,

!bc pycod
def f(a, b, c=2):
    return a + b + c
!ec
We want to ensure that `f` is always called with `c=3`, i.e., `f`
has only two ``free'' arguments `a` and `b`.
This functionality is obtained by

!bc pycod
import functools
f2 = functools.partial(f, c=3)

print f2(1, 2)  # results in 1+2+3=6
!ec
Now `f2` calls `f` with whatever the user supplies as `a` and `b`,
but `c` is always `3`.

Back to our `viz` code, we can do

!bc pycod
import functools
# Call scalar with version fixed to `scalar`
scalar_solver = functools.partial(scalar, version='scalar')
cpu = wave1D_u0.viz(
        I, V, f, c, L, dt, C, T, umin, umax,
        animate, tool, solver_function=scalar_solver)
!ec
The new `scalar_solver` takes the same arguments as
`wave1D_u0.scalar` and calls `wave1D_u0v.scalar`,
but always supplies the extra argument
`version='scalar'`. When sending this `solver_function`
to `wave1D_u0.viz`, the latter will call `wave1D_u0v.solver`
with all the `I`, `V`, `f`, etc., arguments we supply, plus
`version='scalar'`.

=== Efficiency experiments ===

We now have a `viz` function that can call our solver function both in
scalar and vectorized mode. The function `run_efficiency_experiments`
in `wave1D_u0v.py` performs a set of experiments and reports the
CPU time spent in the scalar and vectorized solver for
the previous string vibration example with spatial mesh resolutions
$N_x=50,100,200,400,800$. Running this function reveals
that the vectorized
code runs substantially faster: the vectorized code runs approximately
$N_x/10$ times as fast as the scalar code!

===== Remark on the updating of arrays =====
label{wave:pde1:impl:ref:switch}

At the end of each time step we need to update the `u_nm1` and `u_n`
arrays such that they have the right content for the next time step:

!bc pycod
u_nm1[:] = u_n
u_n[:] = u
!ec
The order here is important: updating `u_n` first, makes `u_nm1` equal
to `u`, which is wrong!

The assignment `u_n[:] = u` copies the content of the `u` array into
the elements of the `u_n` array. Such copying takes time, but
that time is negligible compared to the time needed for
computing `u` from the finite difference formula,
even when the formula has a vectorized implementation.
However, efficiency of program code is a key topic when solving
PDEs numerically (particularly when there are two or three
space dimensions), so it must be mentioned that there exists a
much more efficient way of making the arrays `u_nm1` and `u_n`
ready for the next time step. The idea is based on *switching
references* and explained as follows.

A Python variable is actually a reference to some object (C programmers
may think of pointers). Instead of copying data, we can let `u_nm1`
refer to the `u_n` object and `u_n` refer to the `u` object.
This is a very efficient operation (like switching pointers in C).
A naive implementation like

!bc pycod
u_nm1 = u_n
u_n = u
!ec
will fail, however, because now `u_nm1` refers to the `u_n` object,
but then the name `u_n` refers to `u`, so that this `u` object
has two references, `u_n` and `u`, while our third array, originally
referred to by `u_nm1`, has no more references and is lost.
This means that the variables `u`, `u_n`, and `u_nm1` refer to two
arrays and not three. Consequently, the computations at the next
time level will be messed up since updating the elements in
`u` will imply updating the elements in `u_n` too so the solution
at the previous time step, which is crucial in our formulas, is
destroyed.

While `u_nm1 = u_n` is fine, `u_n = u` is problematic, so
the solution to this problem is to ensure that `u`
points to the `u_nm1` array. This is mathematically wrong, but
new correct values will be filled into `u` at the next time step
and make it right.

The correct switch of references is

!bc pycod
tmp = u_nm1
u_nm1 = u_n
u_n = u
u = tmp
!ec
We can get rid of the temporary reference `tmp` by writing

!bc pycod
u_nm1, u_n, u = u_n, u, u_nm1
!ec
This switching of references for updating our arrays
will be used in later implementations.

!bwarning Caution:
The update `u_nm1, u_n, u = u_n, u, u_nm1` leaves wrong content in `u`
at the final time step. This means that if we return `u`, as we
do in the example codes here, we actually return `u_nm1`, which is
obviously wrong. It is therefore important to adjust the content
of `u` to `u = u_n` before returning `u`. (Note that
the `user_action` function
reduces the need to return the solution from the solver.)

===== Making Movies =====

# GIF is fine for small movies! HTML is superior for large ones

We could also add making a hardcopy of the plot for later production of
a movie file. The hardcopies must be numbered consecutively, say
`tmp_0000.png`, `tmp_0001.png`, `tmp_0002.png`, and so forth.
The filename construction can be based on the `n` counter supplied to
the user action function:
!bc pycod
filename = 'tmp_%04d.png' % n
!ec
The `04d` format implies formatting of an integer in a field of width
4 characters and padded with zeros from the left.
An animated GIF file `movie.gif`
can be made from these individual frames by using
the `convert` program from the ImageMagick suite:
!bc sys
Unix> convert -delay 50 tmp_*.png movie.gif
Unix> animate movie.gif
!ec
The delay is measured in units of 1/100 s.
The `animate` program, also in the ImageMagick suite, can play the movie file.
Alternatively, the `display` program can be used to walk through each
frame, i.e., solution curve, by pressing the space bar.

======= Exercises =======

===== Exercise: Simulate a standing wave =====
label{wave:exer:standingwave}
file=wave_standing

The purpose of this exercise is to simulate standing waves on $[0,L]$
and illustrate the error in the simulation.
Standing waves arise from an initial condition

!bt
\[ u(x,0)= A \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right),\]
!et
where $m$ is an integer and $A$ is a freely chosen amplitude.
The corresponding exact solution can be computed and reads

!bt
\[ \uex(x,t) =  A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mx\right)
\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L}mct\right)\tp
\]
!et

!bsubex
Explain that for a function $\sin kx\cos \omega t$ the wave length
in space is $\lambda = 2\pi /k$ and the period in time is $P=2\pi/\omega$.
Use these expressions to find the wave length in space and period in
time of $\uex$ above.

!bsol
Since the sin and cos functions depend on $x$ and $t$, respectively,
the sin function will run through one period as $x$ increases by $\frac{2\pi}{k}$, while the cos function starts repeating as $t$ increases by $\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$.

The wave length in space becomes
!bt
\[ \lambda =  \frac{2\pi}{\frac{\pi}{L}m} = \frac{2L}{m}\tp
\]
!et
The period in time becomes

\[ P =  \frac{2\pi}{\frac{\pi}{L}mc} = \frac{2L}{mc}\tp

===== Exercise: Add storage of solution in a user action function =====
label{wave:exer:store:list}
file=wave1D_u0_s_store

Extend the `plot_u` function in the file `wave1D_u0.py` to also store
the solutions `u` in a list.
To this end, declare `all_u` as
an empty list in the `viz` function, outside `plot_u`, and perform
an append operation inside the `plot_u` function. Note that a
function, like `plot_u`, inside another function, like `viz`,
remembers all local variables in `viz` function, including `all_u`,
even when `plot_u` is called (as `user_action`) in the `solver` function.
Test both `all_u.append(u)` and `all_u.append(u.copy())`.
Why does one of these constructions fail to store the solution correctly?
Let the `viz` function return the `all_u` list
converted to a two-dimensional `numpy` array.

!bsol
We have to explicitly use a copy of u, i.e. as `all_u.append(u.copy())`, otherwise we just get a reference to `u`, which goes on changing with the computations.

===== Exercise: Use a class for the user action function =====

action function. Let the `all_u` list be an attribute in this class
and implement the user action function as a method (the special method
`__call__` is a natural choice). The class versions avoid that the
user action function depends on parameters defined outside the
function (such as `all_u` in Exercise ref{wave:exer:store:list}).

===== Exercise: Compare several Courant numbers in one movie =====
label{wave:exer:multiple:C}
file=wave_numerics_comparison

The goal of this exercise is to make movies where several curves,
corresponding to different Courant numbers, are visualized. Write a
program that resembles `wave1D_u0_s2c.py` in Exercise ref{wave:exer:store:list:class}, but with a `viz` function that
can take a list of `C` values as argument and create a movie with
solutions corresponding to the given `C` values. The `plot_u` function
must be changed to store the solution in an array (see Exercise
ref{wave:exer:store:list} or ref{wave:exer:store:list:class} for
details), `solver` must be computed for each value of the Courant
number, and finally one must run through each time step and plot all
the spatial solution curves in one figure and store it in a file.

The challenge in such a visualization is to ensure that the curves in
one plot correspond to the same time point. The easiest remedy is to
keep the time resolution constant and change the space resolution
to change the Courant number. Note that each spatial grid is needed for
the final plotting, so it is an option to store those grids too.

!bsol
Modifying the code to store all solutions for each $C$ value and also each corresponding spatial grid (needed for final plotting), we get

===== Exercise: Implementing the solver function as a generator =====
label{wave:exer:useraction:generator}
file=wave1D_u0_generator

The callback function `user_action(u, x, t, n)` is called from the
`solver` function (in, e.g., `wave1D_u0.py`) at every time level and lets
the user work perform desired actions with the solution, like plotting it
on the screen. We have implemented the callback function in the typical
way it would have been done in C and Fortran. Specifically, the code looks
like

!bc pycod
if user_action is not None:
    if user_action(u, x, t, n):
        break
!ec
Many Python programmers, however, may claim that `solver` is an iterative
process, and that iterative processes with callbacks to the user code is
more elegantly implemented as *generators*. The rest of the text has little
meaning unless you are familiar with Python generators and the `yield`
statement.

Instead of calling `user_action`, the `solver` function
issues a `yield` statement, which is a kind of `return` statement:

!bc pycod
yield u, x, t, n
!ec
The program control is directed back to the calling code:

!bc pycod
for u, x, t, n in solver(...):
    # Do something with u at t[n]
!ec
When the block is done, `solver` continues with the statement after `yield`.
Note that the functionality of terminating the solution process if
`user_action` returns a `True` value is not possible to implement in the
generator case.

Implement the `solver` function as a generator, and plot the solution
at each time step.

===== Project: Calculus with 1D mesh functions =====
label{wave:exer:mesh1D:calculus}
file=mesh_calculus_1D

This project explores integration and differentiation of
mesh functions, both with scalar and vectorized implementations.
We are given a mesh function $f_i$ on a spatial one-dimensional
mesh $x_i=i\Delta x$, $i=0,\ldots,N_x$, over the interval $[a,b]$.

!bsubex
Define the discrete derivative of $f_i$ by using centered
differences at internal mesh points and one-sided differences
at the end points. Implement a scalar version of
the computation in a Python function and write an associated unit test
for the linear case $f(x)=4x-2.5$ where the discrete derivative should
be exact.

!esubex

!bsubex
To compute the discrete integral $F_i$ of $f_i$, we assume that
the mesh function $f_i$ varies linearly between the mesh points.
Let $f(x)$ be such a linear interpolant of $f_i$. We then
have

!bt
\[ F_i = \int_{x_0}^{x_i} f(x) dx\tp\]
!et
The exact integral of a piecewise linear function $f(x)$ is
given by the Trapezoidal rule. Show
that if $F_{i}$ is already computed, we can find $F_{i+1}$
from

!bt
\[ F_{i+1} = F_i + \half(f_i + f_{i+1})\Delta x\tp\]
!et
Make a function for the scalar implementation of the discrete integral
as a mesh function. That is, the function should return
$F_i$ for $i=0,\ldots,N_x$.
For a unit test one can use the fact that the above defined
discrete integral of a linear
function (say $f(x)=4x-2.5$) is exact.

!bsol
We know that the difference $F_{i+1} - F_i$ must amount to the area
of a trapezoid, which is exactly what $\half(f_i + f_{i+1})\Delta x$ is.
To show the relation above, we may start with the Trapezoidal rule:

!bt
\begin{equation}
F_{i+1} = \Delta x \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_0) + \sum_{j=1}^{n-1}f(x_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_n) \right] \thinspace . \nonumber
\end{equation}
!et
Since $n = i+1$, and since the final term in the sum may be separated out from the sum and split in two, this may be written as
!bt
\begin{equation}
F_{i+1} = \Delta x \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_0) + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}f(x_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_{i+1}) \right] \thinspace . \nonumber
\end{equation}
!et
This may further be written as
!bt
\begin{equation}
F_{i+1} = \Delta x \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_0) + \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}f(x_j) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_i)\right] + \Delta x \left[\frac{1}{2}f(x_i) + \frac{1}{2}f(x_{i+1}) \right] \thinspace . \nonumber
\end{equation}
!et
Finally, this gives
!bt
\[ F_{i+1} = F_i + \half(f_i + f_{i+1})\Delta x\tp\]
!et
