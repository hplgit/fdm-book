The Euler-Cromer scheme on a standard mesh
------------------------------------------

Consider the fundamental model problem for simple harmonic oscillations,

.. _Eq:stag:vib:ODE2nd:

.. math::

    \tag{362}
    u'' + \omega^2u = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=0,
        
        

where :math:`\omega` is the frequency of the oscillations (the exact solution
is :math:`u(t)=I\cos\omega t`). This model can equivalently be
formulated as two first-order equations,

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:veq:

.. math::

    \tag{363}
    v' = -\omega^2 u,
         
        

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:ueq:

.. math::

    \tag{364}
    u' = v{\thinspace .}
        
        

The popular Euler-Cromer scheme for this :math:`2\times 2` system of ODEs
applies an explicit
forward difference in :ref:`(363) <Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:veq>` and a
backward difference in :ref:`(364) <Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:ueq>`:

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dveq0:

.. math::

    \tag{365}
    \frac{v^{n+1}- v^n}{\Delta t} =- \omega^2u^{n},
        
        

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dueq0:

.. math::

    \tag{366}
    \frac{u^{n+1} - u^n}{\Delta t} = v^{n+1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

For a time domain :math:`[0,T]`, we have introduced a mesh with points
:math:`0=t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_n=T`. The most common case is a mesh with
uniform spacing :math:`\Delta t`: :math:`t_n=n\Delta t`. Then
:math:`v^n` is an approximation to :math:`v(t)` at mesh point :math:`t_n`, and
:math:`u^n` is an approximation to :math:`u(t)` at the same point.
Note that the backward difference in :ref:`(368) <Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dueq>`
leads to an explicit updating formula for :math:`u^{n+1}`
since :math:`v^{n+1}` is already computed:

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dveq:

.. math::

    \tag{367}
    v^{n+1} = v^n -\Delta t \omega^2u^{n},
        
        

.. _Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dueq:

.. math::

    \tag{368}
    u^{n+1} = u^n + \Delta t v^{n+1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The Euler-Cromer scheme is equivalent with the standard second-order
accurate scheme for :ref:`(362) <Eq:stag:vib:ODE2nd>`:

.. _Eq:stag:vib:dODE2nd:

.. math::

    \tag{369}
    u^{n+1} = 2u^n - u^{n-1} - \Delta t^2\omega^2 u^n,\ n=1,2,\ldots,
        
        

but for the first time step, the method for :ref:`(362) <Eq:stag:vib:ODE2nd>`
leads to

.. _Eq:_auto135:

.. math::

    \tag{370}
    u^1= u^0 - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2\omega^2u^0,
        
        

while Euler-Cromer gives

.. _Eq:_auto136:

.. math::

    \tag{371}
    u^1= u^0 - \Delta t^2\omega^2u^0,
        
        

which can be interpreted as a first-order, backward difference approximation
of :math:`u'(0)=0` combined with :ref:`(369) <Eq:stag:vib:dODE2nd>`. At later time steps,
however, the alternating use of forward and backward differences in
:ref:`(367) <Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dveq>`-:ref:`(368) <Eq:stag:vib:EulerCromer:dueq>`
leads to a method with error :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}`.

.. _vib:model2x2:staggered:

The Euler-Cromer scheme on a staggered mesh
-------------------------------------------

.. index:: staggered mesh

.. index:: staggered Euler-Cromer scheme

.. index:: alternating mesh

[**hpl 15**: Do the equations in different sequence, first vel, then pos.]

The fact that the forward and backward differences used the Euler-Cromer
method yield a second-order accurate method is not obvious from intuition.
A much more intuitive discretization employs solely centered differences
and leads to a scheme that is equivalent to the Euler-Cromer scheme.
It is in fact fully equivalent to the second-order scheme for
:ref:`(362) <Eq:stag:vib:ODE2nd>`, also for the first time step.
This alternative scheme is based on using a *staggered* (or
alternating) mesh in time.

In a staggered mesh, the unknowns are sought at different points in
the mesh. Specifically, :math:`u` is sought at
integer time points :math:`t_n` and :math:`v` is sought at :math:`t_{n+1/2}`
*between* two :math:`u` points.
The unknowns are then :math:`u^1, v^{3/2}, u^2, v^{5/2}`, and so on.
We typically use the notation
:math:`u^n` and :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` for the two unknown mesh functions.

On a staggered mesh it is natural to
use centered difference approximations, expressed
in operator notation as

.. _Eq:_auto137:

.. math::

    \tag{372}
    \lbrack D_t u = v\rbrack^{n+\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto138:

.. math::

    \tag{373}
    \lbrack D_t v = -\omega u\rbrack^{n+1}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Writing out the formulas gives

.. _Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:ueq1s:

.. math::

    \tag{374}
    u^{n+1} = u^{n} + \Delta t v^{n+\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1s:

.. math::

    \tag{375}
    v^{n+\frac{3}{2}} = v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} -\Delta t \omega^2u^{n+1}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

Of esthetic reasons one often writes these equations at the
previous time level to replace the :math:`\frac{3}{2}` by :math:`\frac{1}{2}` in the
left-most term in the last equation,

.. _Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:ueq1s2:

.. math::

    \tag{376}
    u^{n} = u^{n-1} + \Delta t v^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1s2:

.. math::

    \tag{377}
    v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = v^{n-\frac{1}{2}} -\Delta t \omega^2u^{n}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

Such a rewrite is only mathematical cosmetics. The important thing
is that this centered scheme has exactly the same computational
structure as the forward-backward scheme. We shall use the names
*forward-backward Euler-Cromer* and *staggered Euler-Cromer*
to distinguish the two schemes.

We can eliminate the :math:`v`
values and get back the centered scheme based on the second-order
differential equation, so all these three schemes are equivalent.
However, they differ somewhat in the treatment of the initial
conditions.

Suppose we have :math:`u(0)=I` and :math:`u'(0)=v(0)=0` as mathematical
initial conditions. This means :math:`u^0=I` and

.. math::
         v(0)\approx \frac{1}{2}(v^{-\frac{1}{2}} + v^{\frac{1}{2}}) = 0,
        \quad\Rightarrow\quad v^{-\frac{1}{2}} =- v^\frac{1}{2}{\thinspace .}

Using the discretized equation :ref:`(377) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1s2>` for
:math:`n=0` yields

.. math::
         v^\frac{1}{2} = v^{-\frac{1}{2}} -\Delta t\omega^2 I,

and eliminating :math:`v^{-\frac{1}{2}} =- v^{\frac{1}{2}}`
results in :math:`v^\frac{1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}\Delta t\omega^2I` and

.. math::
         u^1 = u^0 - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2\omega^2 I,

which is exactly the same equation for :math:`u^1` as we had in the
centered scheme based on the second-order differential equation
(and hence corresponds to a centered difference approximation of
the initial condition for :math:`u'(0)`).
The conclusion is that a staggered mesh is fully equivalent with
that scheme, while the forward-backward version gives a slight
deviation in the computation of :math:`u^1`.

We can redo the derivation of the initial conditions when :math:`u'(0)=V`:

.. math::
         v(0)\approx \frac{1}{2}(v^{-\frac{1}{2}} + v^{\frac{1}{2}}) = V,
        \quad\Rightarrow\quad v^{-\frac{1}{2}} = 2V - v^\frac{1}{2}{\thinspace .}

Using this :math:`v^{-\frac{1}{2}}` in

.. math::
         v^\frac{1}{2} = v^{-\frac{1}{2}} -\Delta t\omega^2 I,

then gives :math:`v^\frac{1}{2} = V - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t\omega^2 I`.
The general initial conditions are therefore

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:u0:

.. math::

    \tag{378}
    u^0 = I,
        
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:v0:

.. math::

    \tag{379}
    v^\frac{1}{2} = V - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t\omega^2I
        {\thinspace .}
        

Implementation of the scheme on a staggered mesh
------------------------------------------------

The algorithm goes like this:

1. Set the initial values :ref:`(378) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:u0>` and
   :ref:`(379) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:v0>`.

2. For :math:`n=1,2,\ldots`:

  1. Compute :math:`u^{n}` from :ref:`(376) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:ueq1s2>`.

  2. Compute :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` from :ref:`(377) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1s2>`.

Implementation with integer indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Translating the schemes :ref:`(376) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:ueq1s2>`
and :ref:`(377) <Eq:vib:model2x2:EulerCromer:veq1s2>` to computer code
faces the problem of how to store and access :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`,
since arrays only allow integer indices with base 0.
We must then introduce a convention: :math:`v^{1+\frac{1}{2}}` is stored
in ``v[n]`` while :math:`v^{1-\frac{1}{2}}` is stored in ``v[n-1]``.
We can then write the algorithm in Python as

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, w, dt, T):
            dt = float(dt)
            Nt = int(round(T/dt))
            u = zeros(Nt+1)
            v = zeros(Nt+1)
            t = linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)  # mesh for u
            t_v = t + dt/2                # mesh for v
        
            u[0] = I
            v[0] = 0 - 0.5*dt*w**2*u[0]
            for n in range(1, Nt+1):
                u[n] = u[n-1] + dt*v[n-1]
                v[n] = v[n-1] - dt*w**2*u[n]
            return u, t, v, t_v

Note that the return :math:`u` and :math:`v` together with the mesh points such
that the complete mesh function for :math:`u` is described by ``u`` and ``t``,
while ``v`` and ``t_v`` represents the mesh function for :math:`v`.

Implementation with half-integer indices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some prefer to see a closer relationship between the code and
the mathematics for the quantities with half-integer indices.
For example, we would like to replace the updating equation for
``v[n]`` by

.. code-block:: python

        v[n+half] = v[n-half] - dt*w**2*u[n]

This is easy to do if we could be sure that ``n+half`` means ``n`` and
``n-half`` means ``n-1``. A possible solution is to define ``half`` as a
special object such that an integer plus ``half`` results in the integer,
while an integer minus ``half`` equals the integer minus 1.
A simple Python class may realize the ``half`` object:

.. code-block:: python

        class HalfInt:
            def __radd__(self, other):
                return other
        
            def __rsub__(self, other):
                return other - 1
        
        half = HalfInt()

The ``__radd__`` function is invoked for all expressions ``n+half``
("right add" with ``self`` as ``half`` and ``other`` as ``n``). Similarly,
the ``__rsub__`` function is invoked for ``n-half`` and results in ``n-1``.

Using the ``half`` object, we can implement the algorithms in an even
more readable way:

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, w, dt, T):
            """
            Solve u'=v, v' = - w**2*u for t in (0,T], u(0)=I and v(0)=0,
            by a central finite difference method with time step dt.
            """
            dt = float(dt)
            Nt = int(round(T/dt))
            u = zeros(Nt+1)
            v = zeros(Nt+1)
            t = linspace(0, Nt*dt, Nt+1)  # mesh for u
            t_v = t + dt/2                # mesh for v
        
            u[0] = I
            v[0+half] = 0 - 0.5*dt*w**2*u[0]
            for n in range(1, Nt+1):
                print n, n+half, n-half
                u[n] = u[n-1] + dt*v[n-half]
                v[n+half] = v[n-half] - dt*w**2*u[n]
            return u, t, v, t_v
        
        def test_staggered():
            I = 1.2; w = 2.0; T = 5; dt = 2/w
            u, t, v, t_v = solver(I, w, dt, T)
            from vib_undamped import solver as solver2
            u2, t2 = solver2(I, w, dt, T)
            error = abs(u - u2).max()
            tol = 1E-14
            assert error < tol
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            test_staggered()

Verification of this code is easy as we can just compare the computed
``u`` with the ``u`` produced by the ``solver`` function in
``vib_undamped.py`` (which solves :math:`u''+\omega^2u=0` directly).  The
values should coincide to machine precision since the two numerical
methods are mathematically equivalent.  We refer to the file
`vib_undamped_staggered.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/vib/vib_undamped_staggered.py>`__
for the details of a nose test that checks this property.

.. _vib:ode2:staggered:

A staggered Euler-Cromer scheme for a generalized model
-------------------------------------------------------

The more general model for vibration problems,

.. _Eq:_auto139:

.. math::

    \tag{380}
    mu'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

can be rewritten as a first-order ODE system

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:ueq:

.. math::

    \tag{381}
    u' = v,

    \tag{382}
    v' = m^{-1}\left(F(t) - f(v) - s(u)\right){\thinspace .}
        
        

It is natural to introduce a staggered mesh (see the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:staggered`) and seek :math:`u` at mesh points :math:`t_n` (the numerical value is
denoted by :math:`u^n`) and :math:`v` between mesh points at :math:`t_{n+1/2}` (the numerical
value is denoted by :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`).
A centered difference approximation to :ref:`(381) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:ueq>`-:ref:`(382) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:veq>` can then be written in operator notation as

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq:

.. math::

    \tag{383}
    \lbrack D_t u = v\rbrack^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq:

.. math::

    \tag{384}
    \lbrack D_tv = m^{-1}\left(F(t) - f(v) - s(u)\right)\rbrack^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

Written out,

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2:

.. math::

    \tag{385}
    \frac{u^n - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t} = v^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2:

    \tag{386}
    \frac{v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}
        = m^{-1}\left(F^n - f(v^n) - s(u^n)\right){\thinspace .}
        
        

With linear damping, :math:`f(v)=bv`, we can use an arithmetic mean
for :math:`f(v^n)`: :math:`f(v^n)\approx = \frac{1}{2}(f(v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}) +
f(v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}))`. The system
:ref:`(385) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2>`-:ref:`(386) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2>`
can then be solved with respect to the unknowns :math:`u^n` and :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`:

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:u:scheme:lin:

.. math::

    \tag{387}
    u^n  = u^{n-1} + {\Delta t}v^{n-\frac{1}{2}},
         
        

.. _Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:v:scheme:lin:

.. math::

    \tag{388}
    v^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = \left(1 + \frac{b}{2m}\Delta t\right)^{-1}\left(

        m^{-1}\left(F^n - {\frac{1}{2}}f(v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}) - s(u^n)\right)\right){\thinspace .}
        
        

In case of quadratic damping, :math:`f(v)=b|v|v`, we can use a geometric mean:
:math:`f(v^n)\approx b|v^{n-\frac{1}{2}}|v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`. Inserting this approximation
in :ref:`(385) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dueq2>`-:ref:`(386) <Eq:vib:ode2:staggered:dveq2>` and
solving for the unknowns :math:`u^n` and :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` results in

.. _vib:exer:quad:damping:fwbw:

Exercise 57: Use the forward-backward scheme with quadratic damping
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the generalized model with quadratic damping, expressed
as a system of two first-order equations as in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`:

.. math::
        
        u^{\prime} &= v,\\ 
        v' &= \frac{1}{m}\left( F(t) - \beta |v|v - s(u)\right){\thinspace .}
        

However, contrary to what is done in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`,
we want to apply the idea of a forward-backward discretization:
:math:`u` is marched forward by a one-sided Forward Euler scheme applied
to the first equation, and
thereafter :math:`v` can marched forward by a Backward Euler scheme in the
second
equation, see in the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`.
Express the idea in operator notation and write out the
scheme. Unfortunately, the backward difference for the :math:`v` equation
creates a nonlinearity :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n}`.  To linearize this
nonlinearity, use the known value :math:`v^n` inside the absolute value
factor, i.e., :math:`|v^{n+1}|v^{n}\approx |v^n|v^{n+1}`.  Show that the
resulting scheme is equivalent to the one in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered` for some time level :math:`n\geq 1`.

What we learn from this exercise is that the first-order differences
and the linearization trick play together in "the right way" such that
the scheme is as good as when we (in the section :ref:`vib:ode2:staggered`)
carefully apply centered differences and a geometric mean on a
staggered mesh to achieve second-order accuracy.
There is a
difference in the handling of the initial conditions, though, as
explained at the end of the section :ref:`vib:model2x2:EulerCromer`.
