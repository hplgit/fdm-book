<p>This section presents a range of wave equation models
for different physical phenomena. Although many wave motion problems
in physics can be modeled by the standard linear wave equation, or a similar
formulation with a system of first-order equations, there are some
exceptions. Perhaps the most important is water waves: these are modeled by
the Laplace equation with time-dependent boundary conditions at
the water surface (long water waves, however, can be approximated
by a standard wave equation, see the section <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-sw-2d"><span class="std std-ref">The linear shallow water equations</span></a>).
Quantum mechanical waves constitute another example where the waves
are governed by the
Schrodinger
equation, i.e., not by a standard wave equation.
Many wave phenomena also need to take nonlinear effects into account
when the wave amplitude is significant. Shock waves in the air is
a primary example.</p>
<p>The derivations in the following are very brief. Those with a firm
background in continuum mechanics will probably have enough
knowledge to fill in the details, while other readers will hopefully
get some impression of the physics and approximations involved when
establishing wave equation models.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-string-fig"><span class="std std-ref">Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</span></a> shows a model we may use to derive
the equation for waves on a string. The string is modeled as a
set of discrete point masses (at mesh points) with
elastic strings in between. The string has a large constant tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span>.
We let the mass at mesh point <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> be <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>. The displacement of
this mass point in the <span class="math">\(y\)</span> direction is denoted by <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The motion of mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span> is governed by Newton&#8217;s second law of motion.
The position of the mass at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x_i\boldsymbol{i} + u_i(t)\boldsymbol{j}\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{j}\)</span> are unit vectors in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> direction, respectively.
The acceleration is then <span class="math">\(u_i''(t)\boldsymbol{j}\)</span>. Two forces are acting
on the mass as indicated in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-string-fig"><span class="std std-ref">Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</span></a>.
The force <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{T}^{-}\)</span> acting toward the point <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> can be decomposed
as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{-} = -T\sin\phi\boldsymbol{i} -T\cos\phi\boldsymbol{j},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is the angle between the force and the
line <span class="math">\(x=x_i\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\Delta u_i = u_i - u_{i-1}\)</span> and let
<span class="math">\(\Delta s_i = \sqrt{\Delta u_i^2 + (x_i - x_{i-1})^2}\)</span>
be the distance from mass <span class="math">\(m_{i-1}\)</span> to mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>.
It is seen that <span class="math">\(\cos\phi = \Delta u_i/\Delta s_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sin\phi =
(x_{i}-x_{i-1})/\Delta s\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\Delta x/\Delta s_i\)</span> if we
introduce a constant mesh spacing <span class="math">\(\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}\)</span>.
The force can then be written</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{-} = -T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_i}\boldsymbol{i} - T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta s_i}\boldsymbol{j}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The force <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{T}^{+}\)</span> acting toward <span class="math">\(x_{i+1}\)</span> can be calculated in a similar way:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{+} = T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_{i+1}}\boldsymbol{i} +
            T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta s_{i+1}}\boldsymbol{j}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Newton&#8217;s second law becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_iu_i''(t)\boldsymbol{j} = \boldsymbol{T}^{+} + \boldsymbol{T}^{-},\]</div>
<p>which gives the component equations</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-hcomp">
\[\tag{279}
T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_i} = T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_{i+1}},\]</div>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-vcomp">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\tag{280}
m_iu_i''(t) = T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta s_{i+1}} -
                   T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta s_i}\\    {\thinspace .}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>A basic reasonable assumption for a string
is small displacements <span class="math">\(u_i\)</span> and small
displacement gradients <span class="math">\(\Delta u_i/\Delta x\)</span>. For small <span class="math">\(g=\Delta u_i/\Delta x\)</span>
we have that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Delta s_i = \sqrt{\Delta u_i^2 + \Delta x^2} = \Delta x\sqrt{1 + g^2}
+ \Delta x (1 + {\frac{1}{2}}g^2 + {\cal O}(g^4) \approx \Delta x
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-string-hcomp"><span class="std std-ref">(279)</span></a> is then simply the identity <span class="math">\(T=T\)</span>, while
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-string-vcomp"><span class="std std-ref">(280)</span></a> can be written as</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_iu_i''(t) = T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta x} - T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta x},\]</div>
<p>which upon division by <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> and introducing the density
<span class="math">\(\varrho_i = m_i/\Delta x\)</span> becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-model0">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\tag{281}
\varrho_i u_i''(t) = T\frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
    \left( u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}\right)\\    {\thinspace .}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>We can now choose to approximate <span class="math">\(u_i''\)</span> by a finite difference in time
and get the discretized wave equation,</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto121">
\[\tag{282}
\varrho_i \frac{1}{\Delta t^2}
    \left(u^{n+1}_i - 2u^n_i - u^{n-1}_i\right) =
    T\frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
    \left( u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}\right){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>On the other hand, we may go to the continuum limit <span class="math">\(\Delta x\rightarrow 0\)</span> and
replace <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(u(x,t)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\varrho_i\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\varrho(x)\)</span>, and
recognize that the right-hand side of <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-string-model0"><span class="std std-ref">(281)</span></a>
approaches <span class="math">\(\partial^2 u/\partial x^2\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\Delta x\rightarrow 0\)</span>.
We end up with the continuous model for waves on a string:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-model1">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\tag{283}
\varrho\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = T\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\\    {\thinspace .}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Note that the density <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> may change along the string, while the
tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is a constant. With variable wave velocity <span class="math">\(c(x) = \sqrt{T/\varrho(x)}\)</span> we can write the wave equation in the more standard form</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-model2">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\tag{284}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\\    {\thinspace .}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Because of the way <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> enters the equations, the variable wave
velocity does <em>not</em> appear inside the derivatives as in many other
versions of the wave equation. However, most strings of interest have
constant <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span>.</p>
<p>The end points of a string are fixed so that the displacement
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> is zero. The boundary conditions are therefore <span class="math">\(u=0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="damping">
<h3>Damping<a class="headerlink" href="#damping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Air resistance and non-elastic effects in the string will contribute
to reduce the amplitudes of the waves so that the motion dies out
after some time. This damping effect can be modeled by a term
<span class="math">\(bu_t\)</span> on the left-hand side of the equation</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-string-model1-damping">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\tag{285}
\varrho\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}
    + b\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  =  T\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\\    {\thinspace .}\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>The parameter <span class="math">\(b\geq 0\)</span> is small for most wave phenomena, but the
damping effect may become significant in long time simulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="external-forcing">
<h3>External forcing<a class="headerlink" href="#external-forcing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to include an external force acting on the string.
Say we have a vertical force <span class="math">\(\tilde f_i\boldsymbol{j}\)</span> acting on mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>, modeling
the effect of gravity on a string.
This force affects the vertical component of Newton&#8217;s law
and gives rise to an extra term <span class="math">\(\tilde f(x,t)\)</span> on the right-hand side of
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-string-model1"><span class="std std-ref">(283)</span></a>. In the model
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-string-model2"><span class="std std-ref">(284)</span></a> we would add a term
<span class="math">\(f(x,t) = \tilde f(x,t)/\varrho(x)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modeling-the-tension-via-springs">
<h3>Modeling the tension via springs<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-the-tension-via-springs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We assumed, in the derivation above, that the tension in the string, <span class="math">\(T\)</span>,
was constant. It is easy to check this assumption by modeling the
string segments between the masses as standard springs, where the
force (tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span>) is proportional to the elongation of the spring segment.
Let <span class="math">\(k\)</span> be the spring constant, and set <span class="math">\(T_i=k\Delta \ell\)</span> for the
tension in the spring segment between <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(\Delta\ell\)</span> is the elongation of this segment from the tension-free state.
A basic feature of a string is that it has high tension in the
equilibrium position <span class="math">\(u=0\)</span>. Let the string segment have an elongation
<span class="math">\(\Delta\ell_0\)</span> in the equilibrium position. After deformation of the
string, the elongation is <span class="math">\(\Delta \ell = \Delta \ell_0 + \Delta s_i\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(T_i = k(\Delta \ell_0 + \Delta s_i)\approx k(\Delta \ell_0 + \Delta x)\)</span>.
This shows that <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span> is independent of <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. Moreover, the extra
approximate elongation <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is very small compared to <span class="math">\(\Delta\ell_0\)</span>,
so we may well set <span class="math">\(T_i = T = k\Delta\ell_0\)</span>. This means that
the tension is completely dominated by the initial tension determined
by the tuning of the string. The additional deformations of the
spring during the vibrations do not introduce significant changes in the
tension.</p>

<p>Consider an elastic rod subject to a hammer impact at the end.
This experiment will give rise to an elastic deformation pulse that travels
through the rod. A mathematical model for longitudinal waves along
an elastic rod starts with the general equation for deformations

Moreover, we set <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{u} = u(x,t)\boldsymbol{i}\)</span> and neglect the radial contraction

will develop elastic waves.  We can model this phenomenon somewhat
similar to waves in a rod: waves in a membrane are simply the

<span id="wave-app-sw-2d"></span><h2>The linear shallow water equations<a class="headerlink" href="#the-linear-shallow-water-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The next example considers water waves whose wavelengths are much
larger than the depth and whose wave amplitudes are small. This class
of waves may be generated by catastrophic geophysical events, such as
earthquakes at the sea bottom, landslides moving into water, or
underwater slides (or a combination, as earthquakes frequently release
avalanches of masses). For example, a subsea earthquake will normally
have an extension of many kilometers but lift the water only a few
meters. The wave length will have a size dictated by the earthquake
area, which is much lager than the water depth, and compared to this
wave length, an amplitude of a few meters is very small.
The water is essentially a thin film, and mathematically we can average
the problem in the vertical direction and approximate the 3D
wave phenomenon by 2D PDEs. Instead of a moving water domain in three
space dimensions, we get a horizontal 2D domain with an unknown function
for the surface elevation and the water depth as a variable coefficient
in the PDEs.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math">\(\eta(x,y,t)\)</span> be the elevation of
the water surface, <span class="math">\(H(x,y)\)</span> the water depth corresponding to a flat
surface (<span class="math">\(\eta =0\)</span>), <span class="math">\(u(x,y,t)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(v(x,y,t)\)</span> the
depth-averaged horizontal velocities of the water. Mass and momentum
balance of the water volume give rise to the PDEs involving these
quantities:</p>

of the bottom and the water volume to say that the bottom
deformation is mirrored at the water surface as an initial lift <span class="math">\(I(x,y)\)</span>
and that <span class="math">\(u=v=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Boundary conditions may be <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> prescribed for incoming, known

mountains, for instance): <span class="math">\(un_x + vn_y =0\)</span>, where <span class="math">\((n_x,n_y)\)</span> is the
outward unit normal to the boundary.  More sophisticated boundary
conditions are needed when waves run up at the shore, and at open

undisturbed.</p>

<p>In the case we have an initial non-flat water surface at rest, the

In such cases the water depth function <span class="math">\(H\)</span> is also a function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>,

the time- and space-varying bottom topography, so that <span class="math">\(H=H_0-B(x,y,t)\)</span>.

being the total volume of blood passing a cross section per time unit,
becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto129">
\[\tag{317}
Q(x,t) = A(x,t)v_x(x,t)
    \thinspace\]</div>
<p>Mass balance and Newton&#8217;s second law lead to the PDEs</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-blood-cont">
\[\tag{318}

    + \frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}
    = -2\pi (\gamma + 2)\frac{\mu}{\varrho}\frac{Q}{A},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is a parameter related to the velocity profile,
<span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> is the density of blood, and <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> is the dynamic viscosity
of blood.</p>
<p>We have three unknowns <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, and two equations
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-blood-cont"><span class="std std-ref">(318)</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-blood-mom"><span class="std std-ref">(319)</span></a>.
A third equation is needed to relate the flow to
the deformations of the wall. A common form for this equation is</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-wave-app-blood-const">
\[\tag{320}
\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{C}
    \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} =0,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is the compliance of the wall, given by the constitutive
relation</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto130">
\[\tag{321}
C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} + \frac{\partial A}{\partial t},\]</div>
<p>which requires a relationship between <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P\)</span>. One common model
is to view the vessel wall, locally, as a thin elastic tube subject to an
internal pressure. This gives the relation</p>
<div class="math">
\[P=P_0 + \frac{\pi h E}{(1-\nu^2)A_0}(\sqrt{A} - \sqrt{A_0}),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(P_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A_0\)</span> are corresponding reference values when the
wall is not deformed, <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is the
thickness of the wall, and <span class="math">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> are Young&#8217;s modulus and
Poisson&#8217;s ratio of the elastic material in the wall.
The derivative becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto131">
\[\tag{322}
C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} =
    \frac{2(1-\nu^2)A_0}{\pi h E}\sqrt{A_0} +
    2\left(\frac{(1-\nu^2)A_0}{\pi h E}\right)^2(P-P_0)
    {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Another (nonlinear) deformation model of the wall, which has a better
fit with experiments, is</p>
<div class="math">
\[P = P_0\exp{(\beta (A/A_0 - 1))},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is some parameter to be estimated. This law leads to</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto132">
\[\tag{323}
C = \frac{\partial A}{\partial P} = \frac{A_0}{\beta P}

<p><strong>Reduction to the standard wave equation.</strong>
It is not uncommon to neglect the viscous term on the right-hand side of
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-blood-mom"><span class="std std-ref">(319)</span></a> and also the quadratic term
with <span class="math">\(Q^2\)</span> on the left-hand side. The reduced equations
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-blood-mom"><span class="std std-ref">(319)</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-wave-app-blood-const"><span class="std std-ref">(320)</span></a> form a first-order
linear wave equation system:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto133">
\[\tag{324}
C\frac{\partial P}{\partial t} = - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x},\]</div>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto134">
\[\tag{325}
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t}
    = - \frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}
    {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>These can be combined into standard 1D wave PDE by differentiating
the first equation with respect to <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and the second with respect to <span class="math">\(x\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( C\frac{\partial P}{\partial t}
\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(
\frac{A}{\varrho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\right),\]</div>
<p>which can be approximated by</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto135">
\[\tag{326}
\frac{\partial^2 Q}{\partial t^2} = c^2\frac{\partial^2 Q}{\partial x^2},\quad
    c = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\varrho C}},\]</div>
<p>where the <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> in the expression for <span class="math">\(c\)</span> are taken as constant
reference values.</p>

<p>Light and radio waves are governed by standard wave equations arising
from Maxwell&#8217;s general equations. When there are no charges and
no currents, as in a vacuum, Maxwell&#8217;s equations take the form</p>
<div class="math">

\nabla\times\pmb{B} &amp;= \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\pmb{E}}{\partial t},

<p>where <span class="math">\(\epsilon_0=8.854187817620\cdot 10^{-12}\)</span> (F/m)

electric constant, and <span class="math">\(\mu_0=1.2566370614\cdot 10^{-6}\)</span> (H/m)

also known as the magnetic constant.
Taking the curl of the two last equations and using the
mathematical identity</p>
